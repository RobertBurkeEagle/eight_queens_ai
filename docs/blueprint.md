# **App Name**: Queens Evolution

## Core Features:

- Interactive Chessboard: Display the current best solution on an 8x8 chessboard in real-time, highlighting the positions of the queens.
- Simulation Controls: Provide buttons to start, pause, and reset the genetic algorithm simulation.
- Parameter Adjustment: Allow users to adjust parameters such as population size and mutation rate to observe their impact on the solution.
- Genetic Algorithm: Employ a genetic algorithm to find the optimal arrangement of eight queens on the chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Use the fitness score to measure performance during each generation.
- Generation Tracking: Track and display the current generation count and the best fitness score achieved.
- Heuristic Advisor Tool: Suggests optimal values for parameters (population size, mutation rate) using a Large Language Model tool, adapting recommendations based on previous simulation data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to give subtle accent to controls.
- Background color: Beige (#F5F5DC), lightly desaturated, providing a traditional chessboard backdrop.
- Accent color: Forest Green (#228B22) contrasts sharply with the background to represent a classic chessboard color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for its modern, objective look, suitable for both titles and explanatory text.
- Use simple, elegant icons for controls (start, pause, reset) in a gold color, resembling chess pieces.
- Arrange the chessboard centrally, with controls and parameters placed around it in a balanced layout.
- Subtly animate the movement of queens on the chessboard as the algorithm progresses, and add transitions to highlight updates in generation count and fitness score.
